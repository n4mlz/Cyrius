# Fixtures Design Notes

## Role and Scope
- Provides source inputs for host-side fixtures generated by `xtask-assets`.
- Each fixture lives in its own subdirectory with its own `DESIGN.md`.

## Usage
- `xtask-assets` builds fixtures into `target/xtask-assets`.
- Fixtures should be deterministic and avoid pulling in libc unless explicitly required.
